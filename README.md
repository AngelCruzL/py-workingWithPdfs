# Working with PDF's

On this repository I attach some python scripts to work with PDF's using `fpdf` library.

To install the libraries used on this repository you can use the following command after start a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Scripts

1. [Creating a PDF](scripts/01-creating_a_pdf.py): This script creates a PDF with an image and some provided text.
2. [Creating a PDF from Excel file](scripts/02-generating_a_pdf_from_spreadsheets.py): This script creates a PDF file from every column of an Excel file with the data provided.
3. [Extracting text from PDF](scripts/03-extracting_text_from_pdf.py): This script extracts the text from a PDF file and displays it in the console.
4. [Extracting tables from PDF](scripts/04-extracting_tables.py): This script extracts the tables from a PDF file and saves it on a CSV file.
