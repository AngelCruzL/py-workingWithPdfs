# Working with PDF's

On this repository I attach some python scripts to work with PDF's using `fpdf` library.

To install the libraries used on this repository you can use the following command after start a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Scripts

1. [Creating a PDF](scripts/01-creating_a_pdf.py): This script creates a PDF with an image and some provided text.
